In this project I made a form where you can register different kinds of medicines. 
I added buttons for each kind of medicine that you can register in the form, and renders the medicines based on their inheritance. 
When the button for each category is clicked, It renders all the info you filled in on the form from earlier. 

When you re-render the page the medicines you previously made is stored in local storage. There is also a delete button, so you can delete anytime you want.
